;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Extensions to `icomplete.el'.
;;
;;  * Better display of candidates, including highlighting them and showing how many there are.
;;  * Shows key bindings for command candidates, optionally including menu bindings.
;;  * Does not bind keys for cycling in `icomplete-mode'.  Defines a separate mode for that, so you
;;    can use Icomplete with or without those key bindings.  (Emacs 24.4+)
;;  * Support for Icicles:
;;    . Respect current Icicles sort order, which you can cycle using `C-,'.
;;    . When you change direction cycling candidates, show the number of other cycle candidates.
;;
;;
;;  Macros defined here (but identical to those in Emacs 23):
;;
;;    `with-local-quit', `with-no-input'.
;;
;;  Commands define here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-cycling-mode'.
;;
;;  Faces defined here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-choices', `icompletep-determined',
;;    `icompletep-keys', `icompletep-nb-candidates'.
;;
;;  User options defined here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-exact-separator',
;;    `icompletep-include-menu-items-flag' (Emacs 23+),
;;    `icompletep-prospects-length' (Emacs < 23),
;;    `icomplete-show-key-bindings'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `icomplete-get-keys' (Emacs > 24.2),
;;    `icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions',
;;    `icompletep-remove-if'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `icomplete.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;    `icomplete-get-keys' (Emacs < 24.3) -
;;       1. Respect `icompletep-include-menu-items-flag'.
;;       2. Do not wrap with `<...>'.
;;       3. If string of keys would be too long then shorten it.
;;
;;    `icomplete-completions' -
;;       1. Prepend the total number of candidates.
;;       2. For file-name completion, respect `completion-ignored-extensions'.
;;       3. With Icicles, sort candidates using `icicle-reversible-sort' and show number of
;;          remaining cycle candidates.  You can cycle the sort order using `C-,'.
;;       4. Show candidates in a different face.
;;       5. Optionally show and highlight key bindings, truncating if too long.
;;
;;    `icomplete-exhibit' -
;;       1. Save match-data.
;;       2. Do not insert if input begins with `(' (e.g. `repeat-complex-command').
;;       3. Ensure that the insertion does not deactivate mark.
;;
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `icomplete.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load "icomplete" '(progn (require 'icomplete+)))
;;
;;  Usage notes:
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23 you can get icompletion of things like
;;    file names also.  See variable (non-option)
;;    `icomplete-with-completion-tables'.  If you set it to the
;;    (undocumented) value `t' then icompletion is available anytime
;;    the completion COLLECTION parameter is a function, which
;;    includes file-name completion.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24 you can specify the kinds of completion
;;    you want by customizing option `completion-category-overrides'
;;    for file names, buffer names, bookmark names, and so on.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24.4, Icomplete mode automatically binds
;;    keys that are otherwise useful in the minibuffer (for Isearch,
;;    symbol completion, etc.) to its own keys for cycling among
;;    icompletion candidates.  This is a BAD idea - see Emacs bug
;;    #13602.  Icomplete+ fixes this by having a separate mode that
;;    binds Icomplete keys, making that optional.  This is analogous
;;    to the difference between `cua-selection-mode' and `cua-mode'.
;;
;;    So with Icomplete+, just turning on Icomplete mode does not
;;    co-opt those keys taking them away from you for use in the
;;    minibuffer.  If you really want to do that then turn on
;;    `icomplete-cycling-mode' in addition to `icomplete-mode'.  And
;;    in that case, consider also choosing different keys to bind in
;;    `icomplete-minibuffer-map' from those that are bound by default.
;;
;;  (The first two features above are not particular to Icomplete+ -
;;  they are available also for vanilla Icomplete.)

;;
;;; Change Log:

;;     Added: icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions.
;;     icomplete-completions (Emacs 24 version):
;;       Rewrote to support Icicles sorting and Emacs 24 candidate metadata:
;;         Use icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions instead of all-completions or
;;           completion-pcm--filename-try-filter.
;;         Use completion--field-metadata, last, and base-size.
;;         Use completion-try-completion, not try-completion.
;;         Do not sort using string-lessp (sorted by icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions).
;; 2012/12/19 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions: Use width of icomplete-separator, not 1 or 2.  Use string-width more.

;;                            For Emacs 23 & 24: Use try-completion, not completion-try-completion.
;; 2012/06/16 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions (Emacs 23+):
;;       Use actual length of nb-cands-string, not min length from %7d format spec.

;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Removed (icomplete-mode 99) at end.
;; 2004/04/13 dadams
;;     I'm not sure that some of the "enhancements" here are still
;;     needed.  This code was written long ago.  In particular, I'm not
;;     sure that the changes to `icomplete-exhibit' and the
;;     redefinitions of the Emacs primitives are needed.  Even if they
;;     are not needed, I'm leaving them in, as they are benign :).
;; 1995/12/15 dadams
;;     Defined replacements that reset minibuffer-completion-table to avoid
;;     icompletion: read-string, read-from-minibuffer, read-no-blanks-input.
;; 1995/11/30 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of yes-or-no-p.
;; 1995/10/17 dadams
;;     1) Added icomplete-choices-face and icomplete-determined-face.
;;     2) Redefined icomplete-exhibit: Doesn't insert if input
;;        begins with `('  (e.g. repeat-complex-command).

  (defun icomplete-completions (name candidates predicate require-match)
    "Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.
NAME is the name to complete.
CANDIDATES is the collection of candidates to match.  See
`completing-read' for its possible values.
PREDICATE filters matches: they succeed only if it returns non-nil.
REQUIRE-MATCH non-nil means the input must match a candidate.

The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during
minibuffer completion.

Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by
\"()\", \"[]\", or \"{}\".  The choice of brackets is as follows:

  \(...) - A single prospect is identified, and matching is enforced.
  \[...] - A single prospect is identified, and matching is optional.
  \{...} - Multiple prospects are indicated, and further input is
          needed to distinguish a single one.

The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [ Matched ]' appended
\(whether complete or not), or ` \[ No matches ]', if no eligible
matches exist.  Keybindings for uniquely matched commands are
shown within brackets, [] (without the word \"Matched\"), if there is
room.

When more than one completion is available, the total number precedes
the suffixes display, like this:

  M-x forw    14 (ard-) { char line list...}

In Icicle mode:
 * The current Icicles sort order is used.
 * When cycling candidates and you change direction, the number of
   other cycling candidates is shown, as `(N more)'.  For example:

   M-x forward-line   [Matched]  (13 more)."
