;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Purpose:
;; 
;; Fuzzy-match is a package of functions to provide non-exact comparison
;; between strings.  Since I am no expert on such things, and certain criteria
;; for non-exact comparison had to be dropped for reasons of efficiency (e.g.,
;; transposition), and the non-exact nature of non-exact comparison, this
;; package may or may not provide what you want.
;;
;; Caveat:
;;
;; This is fuzzy software.  Use it at your own risk.
;;
;; The fuzzy-matcher deals with comparing strings.  For a programmer wishing to
;; use the fuzzy-match library, the front-end functions are likely to be
;; `FM-matchiness' (and corresponding `FM-closeness'), `FM-all-fuzzy-matches'
;; (and corresponding `FM-all-close-matches'), and `FM-fuzzy-sort'.  These can
;; be thought to mirror `string-match', `all-completions' and `sort'.
;; 
;; The function `FM-matchiness' returns an integer which is the number of
;; matching characters from STRING1 in STRING2.  What denotes "the number of
;; matching characters" is arbitrary.
;; 
;; The fuzziness between two strings, STRING1 and STRING2, is calculated by
;; finding the position in STRING2 of a prefix of STRING1.  The first character
;; of STRING1 is found in STRING2.  If we find it, we continue matching
;; successive characters from STRING1 at successive STRING2 positions.  When we
;; have found the longest prefix of STRING1 in STRING2, we decide whether it is
;; a match.  It is considered a match if the length of the prefix is greater or
;; equal to the offset of the beginning of the prefix of STRING1 in STRING2.
;; This means that "food" will match "barfoo" because "foo" (the prefix)
;; matches "foo" in "barfoo" with an offset and length of 3.  However, "food"
;; will not be considered to match "barfu", since the length is 1 while the
;; offset is 3.  The fuzz value of the match is the length of the prefix.  If
;; we find a match, we take the prefix off STRING1 and the string upto the end
;; of the match in STRING2.  If we do not find a match, we take off the first
;; character in STRING1.  Then we try and find the next prefix.
;;
;; So, to walk through an example:
;;
;; (FM-matchiness "pigface" "pigsfly"):
;;
;; STRING1              STRING2         MATCH LENGTH    OFFSET          FUZZ
;; pigface              pigsfly         3               0               3
;; face                 sfly            1               1               1
;; ace                  ly              0               0               0
;; ce                   ly              0               0               0
;; c                    ly              0               0               0
;;
;;      => 4
;; 
;; (FM-matchiness "begining-of-l" "beginning-of-l"):
;; 
;; STRING1              STRING2         MATCH LENGTH    OFFSET          FUZZ
;; begining-of-l        beginning-of-l  5               0               5
;; ing-of-l             ning-of-l       8               1               8
;;
;;      => 13
;;
;; Another function of interest is `FM-all-fuzzy-matches'.  This returns a list
;; of those strings that have the highest fuzzy match with a given string.
;; Those strings are sorted so that there is a preference for strings with the
;; same number of characters, and sharing the longest prefix with the given
;; string:
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches "abc" '("xxabcxx" "xabcxxx" "xabx"))
;;      => ("xabcxxx" "xxabcxx")
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches "point-mx" (all-completions "point" obarray))
;;      => ("point-max" "point-max-marker")
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches "begining-of-l" (all-completions "begin" obarray))
;;      => ("beginning-of-line")
;;
;; Corresponding to `FM-matchiness' and `FM-all-fuzzy-matches' are
;; `FM-closeness' and `FM-all-close-matches'.  They differ from the former
;; functions in that they take into account the difference in length between
;; the target string and candidate string:
;;
;; (FM-closeness "begining-of-l" "beginning-of-l")
;;      => 12
;;
;; Note from above that the matchiness is 13 and the difference in length of
;; the two strings is 1.
;;
;; (FM-all-close-matches "point-mx" (all-completions "point" obarray))
;;      => ("point-max")
;;
;; Note from above that although the matchiness is equal between the target
;; "point-mx" and the candidates "point-max" and "point-max-marker", the former
;; candidate has less of a difference in length from the target.
;;
;; Other functions that may be of use to package writers using this package are
;; `FM-map-fuzzy-matches' (and corresponding `FM-map-close-matches') and
;; `FM-max-matchiness' (and corresponding `FM-max-closeness').  The mapping
;; functions map matchiness or closeness to a list, while the max functions
;; return the maximum matchiness or closeness from a list.
;;
;; Also provided are some interface functions for user packages.  These
;; functions are `FM-offer-corrections' and `FM-list-candidates'.  To
;; demonstrate the usefulness of this package, `lisp-spell-symbol' (analogous
;; to `lisp-complete-symbol') is provided.  Without an arg, the command uses
;; `FM-all-close-matches' to find spelling corrections:
;;
;; (goto-char (point-mx M-x lisp-spell-symbol RET
;;      -| Replaced point-mx with point-max
;; (goto-char (point-max
;;
;; With a double prefix arg, the command uses `FM-all-fuzzy-matches' to find
;; spelling corrections:
;;
;; (goto-char (point-mx C-u C-u M-x lisp-spell-symbol RET
;;      -| Possible candidates are:
;;      -| point-max                       point-max-marker
;;
;; Any number of prefix args means that the user is prompted when replacing
;; with the single correction candidate.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this file where your Emacs can find it and byte compile it.
;;
;; To use, put in your package that uses these functions:
;;
;; (require 'fuzzy-match)
;; 
;; To use the interactive package, put the following in your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;; (autoload 'lisp-spell-symbol "fuzzy-match"
;;   "Perform spell checking on Lisp symbol preceding point." t)
;; (define-key esc-map "#" 'lisp-spell-symbol)
;;
;; This will define the key M-# (ESC #) to call `lisp-spell-symbol'.
;; For Emacs-19 users you can also add an entry to the "ispell" menu-bar:
;;
;; (define-key-after ispell-menu-map [ispell-symbol]
;;   '("Check Symbol" . lisp-spell-symbol) 'ispell-word))
;;
;;
;;  If you like `fuzzy-match.el', you might also be interested in
;;  Icicles, which lets you use the same fuzzy matching for minibuffer
;;  input completion: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.

;;; Code:

;;; Bizarre, but FM-strstr-intern and FM-matchiness-intern are quickest when
;;; dealing with lists.  If coded to deal with strings using aref and
;;; string-match, it takes longer.  (Though this might not be true if we had a
